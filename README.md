# Introduction

Hello reader! You're about to add In-App Purchases to your Cordova Application, let this be your guide in the process.

I'm Jean-Christophe Hoelt, from Fovea, author of the In-App Purchase plugin. I built this guide as a collection of step-by-step recipes, each focusing on 1 specific goal. As soon as you know what your goal is, I will try to explain all the required steps to achieve it. I'll also give you details about what the In-App Purchase technology is, how it works and what it can do for you.

Hopefully, it'll contain all the information you need from start to finish.

While I'm focusing on Cordova, it should be easy to transpose the tutorials to all platforms based on Cordova \(PhoneGap, Ionic, ...\).

### How to get started?

This guide isn't necessary meant to be read from start to finish. Feel free to jump to your section of interest using the left menu. Each section should be self-sufficient, giving you links to other sections when required. The [Let's Get Started](lets-get-started.md) page is conceived as the "Homepage" for the guide, so it comes next.

The first page of the guide, [About IAP Technology](introduction/generalities-about-iap-technology.md), will introduce you to the In-App Purchase technology, in terms of what you can do with it on both iOS and Android, and the difference between those platforms.

If you already know enough about that, you can figure out your use-case and jump right to it using the [Let's Get Started](lets-get-started.md) page.
