# Introduction

Hello reader! You're about to add In-App Purchases to your Cordova Application, let this be your guide in the process.

I'm Jean-Christophe Hoelt, from Fovea, main developer of the In-App Purchase plugin. I built this guide for you as a collection of step-by-step recipes, each focusing on one specific goal. As soon as you know what your goal is, I will try to explain all the required steps to achieve it. I'll also give you general details about what the In-App Purchase technology is, how it works and what it can do for you.

Hopefully, it'll contain all the information you need from start to finish.

While I'm focusing on Cordova, it should be easy to transpose the tutorials to all platforms based on Cordova \(PhoneGap, Ionic, ...\).

Note that the most up-to-date version is available as a gitbook at https://purchase.cordova.fovea.cc/

### How to get started?

This guide isn't meant to be read from start to finish. Feel free to jump to your use case of interest from the summary. Each guide should be self-sufficient.

However, the little introduction [About IAP Technology](introduction/generalities-about-iap-technology.md) will introduce you to the In-App Purchase technology, in terms of what you can do with it on both iOS and Android, and the difference between those platforms.

If you think you already know enough about that, you can jump right to your use case using the [menu](SUMMARY.md) on the left.
