# Introduction

Hello reader! You're about to add In-App Purchases to your Cordova Application, let this be your guide in the process.

I'm Jean-Christophe Hoelt, from Fovea, main developer of the In-App Purchase plugin. I built this guide for you as a collection of step-by-step recipes, each focusing on one specific goal. As soon as you know what your goal is, I will try to explain all the required steps to achieve it. I'll also give you general details about what the In-App Purchase technology is, how it works and what it can do for you.

Hopefully, it'll contain all the information you need from start to finish.

While I'm focusing on Cordova, it should be easy to transpose the tutorials to all platforms based on Cordova \(PhoneGap, Ionic, ...\).

Note that the most up-to-date version is available as a gitbook at https://purchase.cordova.fovea.cc/

### Contribute to this guide

The main repository is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase-documentation.

The content is aimed to be digested by [gitbook](https://gitbook.com). Pull requests are welcome.

### How to get started?

The [little introduction to IAP technology](introduction/generalities-about-iap-technology.md) will introduce you to the In-App Purchase technology, in terms of what you can do with it on both iOS and Android, and the difference between those platforms.

If you like a (tiny) bit of theory, you can read the section on [the cordova plugin](introduction/about-the-plugin.md).

Then, you can jump right to your use case.
